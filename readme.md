# Better Buff Bar

Track only the buffs that actually matter.

## Installation

To install Better Buff Bar copy & paste this link into your browser:
alt1://addapp/https://nadyanayme.github.io/BetterBuffBar/dist/appconfig.json

**Currently only works with Small Buff icons**. Alt1's BuffReader only works with small buff icons so this is unlikely to change soon.

## Features

- Track up to 15 buffs (if you're tracking more than this just use the in-game buff bar TBH)
- Pin buffs to always appear in a specific position
- Choose between fading the buff out when inactive or hiding it from the better buff bar


## Settings

Check the box for the supported buffs that you wish to track and assign them a priority. **Lower** number is higher priority.

## Known Issues

- Overlay will appear cut off on the right side if the plugin window isn't wide enough. Make the app wider (you can minimize it after) to resolve this issue.

If you encounter any other bugs - please submit an issue and I'll investigate it.
