# Better Buff Bar

Track only the buffs that actually matter.

## Installation

To install Better Buff Bar copy & paste this link into your browser:
alt1://addapp/https://nadyanayme.github.io/BetterBuffsBar/dist/appconfig.json

**Currently only works with Small Buff icons**. Alt1's BuffReader only works with small buff icons so this is unlikely to change soon.

- Drag & drop buffs into desired display order
- Select number of buffs that should appear in each row
- Decide whether buffs should disappear or turn grayscale when inactive
- **Set Overlay Position before enabling Overlay** (if you don't you'll have to restart the app again to get the Overlay to work)
- Enable Overlay

## Features

- Track important buffs (if it isn't listed it wasn't important enough - but more seriously DM me @ NadyaNayme on Discord if you'd like to add a buff to bet racked)
- Select order that buffs should be displayed and which should be tracked.
- Choose between fading the buff out when inactive or hiding it from the better buff bar


## Settings

Check the box for the supported buffs that you wish to track and assign them a priority. **Lower** number is higher priority.

## Known Issues

- UI Scale >100% results in it being cut off.

If you encounter any other bugs - please submit an issue and I'll investigate it.
